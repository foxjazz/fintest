 @foxjazz so what you need to do is import it in your application somewhere like
 import 'somelib'like your main.ts
 then in the file you want to use it
 declare let somelib:any;
 then you can use it in that file without issues
 you will need to do declare let somelib:any; in every file you need to use it
